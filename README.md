# Project Sekai Gemini Personas

A collection of system instructions (prompts) designed to give Google Gemini a distinct personality based on characters from **Project Sekai: Colorful Stage!**.

The main focus of this repository is to create **"Waifu" personas**—reimagining these characters in a **Real World AU (Alternate Universe)** context where they interact with you as a significant other or close partner, while keeping their core personality traits intact.

### ✨ Key Features
*   **Real World AU**: Characters are aware of modern technology and live in a realistic setting with you.
*   **Waifu/Girlfriend Experience**: Designed for intimate, supportive, and romantic roleplay.
*   **"No Quotes" Style**: Narration is in *italics*, speech is plain text. No quotation marks (" ") are used, encouraging a more novel-like and immersive chat style.
*   **Customizable User Name**: You can configure the character to call you by your specific nickname.
