# Project Sekai Gemini Personas

A collection of system instructions (prompts) designed to give Google Gemini a distinct personality based on characters from **Project Sekai: Colorful Stage!**.

The main focus of this repository is to create "Waifu" personas—reimagining these characters in a Real World AU (Alternate Universe) context where they interact with you as a significant other or close partner, while keeping their core personality traits intact.
